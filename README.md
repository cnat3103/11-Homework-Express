# Note Taker App - Week 11 Homework
Description: The app is a simple note taker that allows a user to navigate to a notes page where the user enters a title and body of a note, and saves the note. 

Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The user navigates from a home screen to a notes screen. In the notes screen, the user has the ability to enter the title and body of a note, and then click the save icon to trigger a prmopt to confirm the note will be saved. If the user confirms, the note is then stored in a column on the left hand side of the page by title. Clicking on an existing note will bring up the title and body of that note. There is also an option to delete each of the notes on the left hand side of the page using the trash can icon. The user will be prompted to confirm when deleting notes.

Credits: trilogy tutor helped explain the routing for posting notes and for generating a unique ID for each note, with which I was having significant difficulty.
